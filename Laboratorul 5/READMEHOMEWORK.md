Regarding the homework part of the laboratory, I tried to create other classes as requested to be able to do the commands required from the task.
I created all except the HTML report one because I couldn't understand properly how to use the libraries with the required templates.
The commands mostly work, not all at once because the NameException class finds improper to search in the already made file to do a print/load/html report/etc task.
As far as the classes are concerned, I did not bring many changes to the main classes from the compulsory part but still I created them again so the problems are clear and easy to understand.
This week I did not have enough time to focus on the homework, but I will adapt the current code to any suggestions that you will make.
