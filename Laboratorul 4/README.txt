In the compulsory part of the 4th laboratory, I implemented all the basic functions that were required in the problem:
1. I created the project as Maven project
2. I used the object oriented programming principles to execute the instructions
3. I printed all the things required using types of lists of sets and I tried to think of a way to check duplicates and to see if the objects are comparable

In the homework part of the laboratory, I implemented the tasks using all the required fields:
1. I created a class that described the city with also the implementation of a custom function that prints on screen adjacency lists and all the streets in the city
2. In the Main function, I used some additional libraries such as faker and some JGraphT classes in order to solve some problems such as minimum spanning tree.
3. I solved the problems above of the duplicates and the comparables, so I think now it works the way it is supposed to by adding 2 more functions
4. I didn't implement any custom class to do the things required, even if I tried I didn't have time this week to solve more than the minimum required
