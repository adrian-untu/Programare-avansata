Hello! 
Regarding the 7th laboratory, we had to create a game with words
I used for the homework 8 classes, which will be explained now:
1. Bag - this class contains the letters and the points that are needed
2. Board - this is the board of the game, functions taken from the slides
3. Dictionary - this class only has the function to check if words exist
4. Game - the main class, which has the logic of the game, has all the classes used in it so the game can function properly even with using threads
5. MockDictionary - this class has the file with the words that was generated
6. Player - this class implements how each player should act
7. Tile - class that contains the tiles, functions taken from the course
8. Timekeeper - this class keeps track of the progress each player made
